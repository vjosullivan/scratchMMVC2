# scratchMMVC2

This is just a scratch project for me (i.e. It's just for testing concept to confirm I understand them.)

A sample app that uses a high level View Controller to co-ordinate lower level VCs. The purpose is to show that iOS MVC pattern need not result in massive VCs, if handled correctly.  The objective is to keep the architecture simple without resorting to MMVC or VIPER patterns.
